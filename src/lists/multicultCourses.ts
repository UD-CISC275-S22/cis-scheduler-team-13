In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism.

In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

Students also gain understanding and awareness of how to incorporate socio-demographic-economic value differences in addressing stakeholder concerns and wildlife policy development.  The second half of the semester details the historical creation and oversight of policies related to federal agencies toward wildlife and wildlife habitat in the face of a growing and changing society. While the second half provides an overview of many policies, it also uses lengthier case studies to detail the interaction of human dimensions with wildlife conservation. Because wildlife and fisheries management in the 21<sup>st</sup> century has as much to do with human dimensions, economics and equity, social politics, and environmental policy, as it does ecology principles; this course is designed to prepare students to succeed as wildlife and natural resource professionals.",

Using both a theoretical and applied approach, we will analyze how historical and contemporary realities of women of color are influenced by a legacy of structural inequalities. The approach to this course will pay particular attention to sociological aspects of identity as well as cultural representations that are manifestations of systems of oppression. Finally, the course moves beyond intersectionality as \u201cidentity politics\u201d and examines the ways in which power is deployed through interlocking systems of oppression including white supremacy, patriarchy, and advanced capitalism.",
