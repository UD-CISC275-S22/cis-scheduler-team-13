What can we learn about these problems and potential solutions from looking at how diverse societies relate to nature and manage resources? What can we learn from indigenous peoples, social movements, and intentional communities whose values and practices offer alternative visions for how to organize human-environment relations? This course draws on anthropological methods and research findings to examine diverse ways of defining \u201csustainability\u201d and living sustainably. We apply these findings to critically examine current debates and approaches to environmental issues, from the United Nations Climate Change accords to corporate sustainability platforms and environmental justice movements.",

We approach law as a system of rules, obligations, and procedures. We also understand it as a cultural practice and moral regime. We ask: how are law, politics, and economics enmeshed and with what consequences? How does law provide tools for both social struggle and social control? How does anthropology contribute to our understanding of these issues? To answer these questions, we combine readings from classical legal anthropology with recent writings and other media produced by anthropologists, journalists, and activists working across the globe. This course is of particular interest to students concerned with law, policy, government, and related professions, as well as issues of social justice and diversity.",
