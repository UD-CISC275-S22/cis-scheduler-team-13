We will read Black women\u2019s writing, examine the ways Black women fashioned their own bodies, and we will survey Black women\u2019s art throughout this early period. We will examine a wide range of sources including periodicals, slave narratives, memoir/autobiography, oral history, poetry, visual art, film, and music, in addition to assigned secondary literature. In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism. A primary goal will be to consider how Black women have worked to determine their own lives and possess their own bodies while other groups have sought to dominate and control them.",

Throughout the course, we will look closely at the demographic, economic, and geographic opportunities for enslaved mobility and resistance that shaped the formation of the Atlantic world. The central focus will be an analysis of the historical impact of marronage across the Americas from 1502 to 1865.",
