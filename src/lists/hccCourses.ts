Throughout this course, Black women\u2019s voices will be central. We will read Black women\u2019s writing, examine the ways Black women fashioned their own bodies, and we will survey Black women\u2019s art throughout this early period. We will examine a wide range of sources including periodicals, slave narratives, memoir/autobiography, oral history, poetry, visual art, film, and music, in addition to assigned secondary literature. In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women\u2019s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism. A primary goal will be to consider how Black women have worked to determine their own lives and possess their own bodies while other groups have sought to dominate and control them.",

A consideration of the fighting itself and the impact of military conflict on the Confederate and Union homefronts will follow.",
